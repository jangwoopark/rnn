# Recurrent Neural Networks project: time series prediction and text generation

## Use Colab in google for great GPU accelaration!

### Build your Own Deep Learning Workstation

If you have access to a GPU, you should follow the Keras instructions for [running Keras on GPU](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-run-keras-on-gpu).

### Clean up a large text corpus

| Criteria       		|     Meets Specifications	        			            | 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:| 
| Find and remove all non-english or punctuation characters from input text data.  All non-english / non-punctuation characters.  |


### Implement a function to window a large text corpus

| Criteria       		|     Meets Specifications	        			            | 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:| 
| Implement a function to window input text data| The proper windowed version of input text of proper dimension listed in the notebook.  |


### Create a simple RNN model using keras to perform multiclass classification

| Criteria       		|     Meets Specifications	        			            | 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:| 
| Build an RNN model to perform multiclass classification. | RNN model in keras with LSTM module of dimension defined in the notebook.        |


### Generate text using a fully trained RNN model and a variety of input sequences
| Criteria       		|     Meets Specifications	        			            | 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:| 
| Generate text using a trained RNN classifier.   | Examples of generated text from a trained RNN module.  The majority of this generated text should consist of real english words. |

This project would also work on Pytorch if it is correctly translated!

# I am using tensorflow environment in conda for my own server. I installed the requirements in it using pip.
# install h5py in the conda environment or you won't be able to save weights
